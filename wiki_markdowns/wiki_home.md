Welcome to the ChIP-AP wiki!

From here (and on the right) you will find the different guides and tutorials for different aspects of ChIP-AP from detailed setup, to Q&A's and guides on interpreting ChIP-AP's output directory structure.

For an overview of ChIP-AP, refer to our [guide](https://github.com/JSuryatenggara/ChIP-AP/wiki/ChIP-AP-Guide).

For _**VERY**_ detailed documentation of ChIP-AP's outputs and the inner workings of this beast, refer to the [documentation wiki](https://github.com/JSuryatenggara/ChIP-AP/wiki/ChIP-AP-Outputs).

_**Installation instructions for advanced users can be found on the github's [main page](https://github.com/JSuryatenggara/ChIP-AP).**_ Those found here are detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots for users to set up ChIP-AP on modern OS'es who require a little extra support to get things running. If you run into issues while installing, this will almost certainly be because of previous configurations that are disrupting the installation process. While it'd be great if we can cater to every installation support request, unfortunately we cant as its only 2 of us and not a team supporting ChIP-AP. Do your best using Google to find a solution but if you're really stuck drop an issue request and we'll see what we can do to try and sort you out.
